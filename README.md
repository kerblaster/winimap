Put your community on the map
Winimap has two related functions interconnected into this one website application. 
Its first function is to create a heatmap of the smash community. A heatmap is one unique way to visually display the smashers around your area and around the world. It would be exciting to discover a few dots in the heatmap around when you thought your local area is void of any smashers. 
Its second function is to match smashers around the world with other smashers who want to play. While the heatmap provides information regarding smash population density, this function provides specifics on who wants and is able to play. You can create a post seeking friendlies, hosting friendlies, or organizing a tournament. Using the scan function, smashers can see other smashers who posted they want to play.

Tournament organizers can also use Winimap to promote their tournament. They can post their tournament and its location will be pinned onto the heatmap as well as posted as a search results for scans.

*How to use:*
Homepage - Heatmap (desktop)

Shows population density of the people who signed up. It uses an color gradient to display lesser and greater population areas. By default (signed out), the heatmap focuses on the United States and displays every smasher from every game. It also shows pins of all tournaments. You can hover over a pin of a tournament to find its title and the game played. Different pin icons represent tournament prestige, reference the specific pin icon below. You can further click the pin to find a short summary of it. If logged in, it will show a jumping pin of where you are closely located and a black 100 mile radius for reference. The zoom and center also focus on your location. Click at the jumping pin to re-center. Note, this does not pin any local friendlies.

Homepage - Locations (mobile)

See: Scan - Locations Results Page below 
Redirects to locations results page. Avoids heatmap due to limitations on mobile browser required to view heamaps provided by the google api. If desperate for the heatmap on a mobile setting, you can change mobile browser to request desktop mode.

 About Me
Hi, I'm Renard Tumbokon and I am a Rutgers University student class of 2017 majoring in Computer Science and ITI. I go by the tag 'kerblaster' in the NJ and Tristate area. You can view other things I developed in the past at kerblaster.com. Like I mentioned earlier, I am a college student, so I am pretty broke right now. Right now, I am not running any ads so months worth of development time of Winimap is basically done for free. If you appreciate what I have developed and have extra pennies to spare, you can donate to show your love. Otherwise, if you are a representative of a commited, ambitious, and focused company who sees my work and wants to talk about a possible job opening (or if you have any comments, questions, feedback, hatemail, or otherwise) email me or tweet at me.
