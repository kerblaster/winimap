                <h1> What is Winimap? </h1>
                <center><h2>Put your community on the map</h2></center>
                <p>
                    Winimap has two related functions interconnected into this one website application. 
                    <br>
                    Its <strong>first</strong> function is to create a heatmap of the smash community. 
                    A heatmap is one unique way to visually display the smashers around your area and around the world. 
                    It would be exciting to discover a few dots in the heatmap around when you thought your local area is void of any smashers. 
                    <br>
                    Its <strong>second</strong> function is to match smashers around the world with other smashers who want to play. 
                    While the heatmap provides information regarding smash population density, this function provides specifics on who wants and is able to play. 
                    You can create a post seeking friendlies, hosting friendlies, or organizing a tournament. 
                    Using the scan function, smashers can see other smashers who posted they want to play.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Tournament organizers can also use Winimap to promote their tournament. 
                    They can post their tournament and its location will be pinned onto the heatmap as well as posted as a search results for scans.

        <h3>How to use: (clarifications)</h3>

        <p>
            Shows population density of the people who signed up. 
            It uses an color gradient to display lesser and greater population areas. 
            By default (signed out), the heatmap focuses on the United States and displays every smasher from every game. 
            It also shows pins of all tournaments. 
            You can hover over a pin of a tournament to find its title and the game played. 
            Different pin icons represent tournament prestige, reference the specific pin icon below.
